Ten years ago, faculty members and technologists at New York City College of Technology (City Tech), part of the 25-campus City University of New York (CUNY) system, created the OpenLab at City Tech (https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/), an open platform for teaching, learning, and collaboration that everyone at the college can use (Edwards et al.). The OpenLab is a vital hub of activity for the City Tech community, serving more than 39,000 members to date – students, faculty, staff, and alumni. Recently we partnered with The Graduate Center, CUNY’s Commons In A Box project (CBOX, https://commonsinabox.org/) to build Commons In A Box OpenLab (https://cboxopenlab.org/), free and open source software that enables anyone to launch a commons for open learning. Since then, several institutions have launched their own OpenLabs, including Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC), (https://openlab.bmcc.cuny.edu/), also at CUNY.

CBOX OpenLab’s mission is to create powerful and flexible open infrastructure that provides an alternative to “black-boxed technologies that amass and commercialize data on students, often without their knowledge” (Noble and Roberts 2017). In contrast with closed, proprietary systems designed by external vendors and driven by market concerns, CBOX OpenLab is built by and with the communities it serves, and in alignment with the needs and values of open education. It provides an open online space where community members work together beyond the classroom and across institutional boundaries, sharing ideas with one another and the world. Combining the open source publishing platform WordPress with BuddyPress for social networking, it is specifically designed to support open pedagogies and open educational resources, fostering interdisciplinary approaches and sharing of best practices. Communities can make their work more visible and accessible, and students can create and customize their own learning spaces, actively participating in the construction of their knowledge (Rosen and Smale 2015).

Our presentation introduces the platform, sharing example uses from the City Tech and BMCC OpenLabs, including some of the creative ways members have used key features in response to the pandemic. We recognize that, while platforms shape behavior, in Stommel’s words, they can’t “magically change our teaching practices” and we “must continually poke and prod at their intentions, the assumptions we've baked into them” (2017). So we will also reflect on both the benefits and challenges of using, building, and supporting open infrastructure for open learning. Finally, we will discuss lessons learned, share recommendations for those who are interested in adopting the platform or pursuing similar initiatives, and connect participants with a growing community of practitioners.
