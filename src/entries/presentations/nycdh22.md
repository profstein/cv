Commons In A Box OpenLab (https://cboxopenlab.org/) is free, open source software that enables anyone to create a commons space specifically designed for open learning, where students, faculty, and staff can collaborate across disciplinary boundaries and share their work openly with one another and the world.

The project brings together Commons In A Box, the software that powers NYCDH (CBOX, https://commonsinabox.org/), and City Tech’s OpenLab platform for teaching, learning, and collaboration (https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/). The result is a teaching-focused version of CBOX that provides a powerful and flexible alternative to closed, proprietary systems, and is already being adopted at CUNY and beyond.

We will showcase CBOX OpenLab’s features and functionality, using examples from City Tech’s OpenLab and BMCC’s installation of the software (https://openlab.bmcc.cuny.edu/), then discuss how CBOX OpenLab can support open learning in your community.
